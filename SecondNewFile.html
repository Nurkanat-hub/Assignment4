              <p class="blog-post-meta">December 2, 2005<a href="#">Nurkanat</a></p>
      
              <p> I was born on a clear winter's day, a happy little chubby boy.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>In short, I grew up until I was 5 years old at my grandmother's house, she taught me to read books and taught me to think.Also after moving to another house my lazy life began, I studied when I had to study, memorised when I had to memorise.And so I finished school, which was very interesting by the way because I didn't take anything close.</p>
              <h2>Characterisation</h2>
              <p>Some Characterisation from my friends</p>
              <blockquote class="blockquote">
              </blockquote>
              <p>Purposefulness, negotiation skills, able to control emotions and deal with stress, ability to memorise and retrieve information, not capable of teamwork</p>
              <h3>About my Hobbie</h3>
              <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Body</li>
                <li>Mind</li>
                <li>Soul</li>
              </ul>
              <dl>
                <dt>Maintaining the Body:</dt>
                <dd>It’s not just about physical activity, but a comprehensive approach to health. You likely understand the importance of balancing strength training, cardio workouts, and flexibility exercises. Perhaps you engage in sports that not only build muscle but also enhance endurance and coordination.

                    In addition to exercise, maintaining the body includes paying attention to nutrition. You might be mindful of balancing macronutrients and micronutrients, ensuring you have the energy and mental clarity needed for your activities. You probably also focus on quality sleep and recovery methods, such as stretching, massages, or other restorative practices, to optimize your physical health.</dd>
                <dt>Maintaining the Mind:</dt>
                <dd>This is about your constant pursuit of learning and personal development. You likely see the value in regularly challenging your mind for growth. Beyond your university studies and mastering IT technologies, you may seek new knowledge from reading scientific articles, following the latest IT trends, enrolling in courses, or participating in hackathons.

                    Supporting your mind goes beyond academics, too. You might develop analytical and critical thinking skills through games like chess, puzzles, or logic challenges. This helps you sharpen attention to detail and improve strategic thinking, which is vital in your field.</dd>
                <dt>Maintaining the Soul:</dt>
                <dd>This aspect involves deep work on your inner world and emotional stability. Maintaining the soul could include meditation or mindfulness practices that help you stay emotionally balanced amidst the stress and busyness of life. You may dedicate time to self-reflection, practicing gratitude, which nurtures a positive outlook and inner peace.

                    You might also connect with art—whether through music, painting, or reading literature—as a way to express emotions and develop the creative side of your personality. Additionally, connecting with nature through hiking or simply spending time outdoors might be your way of replenishing inner resources and feeling a deeper connection to something greater than everyday routines.</dd>

              <p>In the next three years, I plan to deepen my knowledge in key subjects such as algorithms, data structures, databases, and network technologies. I aim to participate in professional hackathons, competitions, and internships to gain practical experience. Strengthening connections within the professional community is also a priority, as I actively engage in projects to expand my portfolio. In my second year, I intend to secure an internship or part-time job at an IT company to apply the knowledge I've acquired in a real-world setting. Additionally, I will focus on developing deeper skills in my chosen specialization, further enhancing my expertise and career prospects.</p>
